Most people know that when a bear is made unhappy by the presence of a lurking outsider, said bear will often make its displeasure known through a polite roar...

...however, what many do not take the time to discover is that if this perfunctory signal is ignored, most bears have the courtesy to present their desires in an alternative format.
